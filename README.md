A sophisticated, role-based Telegram bot for managing tasks within a team. It features an intelligent parser for natural language task creation and provides distinct interfaces for admins and members.

---

## ✨ Key Features

-   **✅ Role-Based Access Control**: Separate menus and permissions for **Admins** and **Members**.
-   **🤖 Intelligent Task Parsing**: Automatically extracts user IDs and deadlines from natural language messages (e.g., "task for user `123456` by `tomorrow`").
-   **📋 Interactive Menus**: User-friendly navigation with inline keyboard buttons.
-   **💾 Data Persistence**: All tasks and user roles are saved locally in JSON files (`tasks.json`, `roles.json`).
-   **🔔 Admin Notifications**: Admins are notified when a user marks a task as complete.
-   **💬 Simple AI Responder**: Provides answers to basic conversational queries like "hello" or "how are you?".
-   **🔒 Secure**: Ignores sensitive files like `token.txt` and databases via `.gitignore`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+
-   A Telegram Bot Token. You can get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
    *Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure your Bot Token:**
    -   Create a file named `token.txt` in the root directory.
    -   Paste your Telegram Bot Token inside this file. The file should *only* contain the token string.

### Running the Bot

Execute the main script to start the bot:```sh
python main.py
```
The bot is now running and will start listening for commands on Telegram.

## 🤖 How to Use

### 1. First-Time Start
-   Open a chat with your bot on Telegram and send the `/start` command.
-   The bot will ask you to select your role: **Admin** or **Member**. This choice determines the menu you will see.

### 2. Admin Workflow
As an admin, you have access to the following commands via the main menu:
-   **➕ Add Task**: Prompts you to send a message containing the task details. The bot will parse the user's numeric ID, the deadline, and the task description.
    -   *Example*: `Assign project alpha to user 123456789 by next Friday`
-   **👥 Add Member**: Prompts you to enter the numeric Telegram ID of a new user to grant them "Member" access.
-   **📊 Task Report**: Displays a formatted list of all tasks, including their status, assigned user, and deadline information.
-   **🗑️ Delete Task**: Shows a list of all tasks with buttons to delete them individually.

### 3. Member Workflow
As a member, you have a simplified interface:
-   **📌 My Tasks**: Displays a list of all tasks assigned to you.
-   **✅ Mark as Done**: Each task notification you receive includes a "Mark as Done" button. Clicking it updates the task status and notifies all admins.
